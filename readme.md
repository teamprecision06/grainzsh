# grainzsh

minimal zsh configuration for grain network

## what is grainzsh?

grainzsh provides a minimal, intentional shell configuration for
zsh users in the grain network. every line is a conscious choice,
following grain style principles of simplicity and clarity.

## philosophy

the lovers teach that perfect union comes from perfect choices.
grainzsh embodies this: minimal configuration, maximum intention,
zero cruft.

## features

- λ prompt (lambda - transformation through functions)
- intelligent completion
- shared history across terminals
- grain network path integration
- essential git aliases
- clean color scheme

## installation

```bash
# symlink to your home directory
ln -sf ~/github/teamprecision06/grainzsh/template/.zshrc ~/.zshrc

# source it
source ~/.zshrc
```

## structure

```
grainzsh/
  template/
    .zshrc    ← shared configuration
  personal/
    .zshrc    ← your personal additions (gitignored)
```

template is version controlled. personal is yours alone.

## grain style

grainzsh follows grain style principles:

- minimal (56 lines total)
- intentional (every line means something)
- educational (comments explain why, not just what)
- explicit (no hidden magic)
- bounded (finite, knowable, complete)
